# Future ideas from the research notes

Ideas that came out of the local research notes in `docs/research/` (untracked, so they stay on one PC) and are not yet built or recorded as rows in [progress.md](progress.md). Written in our own words, by behavior only; nothing here is copied from another program. Read this page, not the research folder, when planning. Nothing here is approved or scheduled: the owner picks what becomes a session row.

Status words: **Not built** (no sign of it in the code or the tracked docs when this page was written, 2026-10-24), **Check** (probably partly built; look before starting), **Conflicts** (clashes with an approved behavior in [behavior.md](behavior.md)), **Parked** (already a row in progress.md).

## 1. Design intent without history

The relationship chips (which rules carry related faces along) are built. The rest of that plan is not:

| Idea | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| More detected rules | Parallel, perpendicular, tangent-touching and symmetric-about-plane as chips next to the current ones, each with a tolerance. Test against imported parts for false positives | Check (some rules exist; list them against the code before starting) |
| Rule state on the chips | Show whether a rule is on and used, off and would have moved something, or on and irrelevant; say why a face moved | Not built |
| One-shot alignment tools | "Make coaxial", "make coplanar", "make parallel" with a picked target; afterwards the relationship detects as present | Not built |
| Typed dimension as a driver | Click a measurement, type a new value, choose which end moves (the swap arrows). Built for face distance, hole distance, edge length and a few more; not for every measurement | Check |
| Hole and pattern recognition | Group holes by diameter and detect line, grid and circle spacing as a selection helper for the resize, move and array tools; nothing stored | Not built |
| Work frame handle | A movable origin, axis and plane (with snaps) that move and rotate tools can take as direction or pivot | Not built |
| Soft locks | Lock a relationship by remembering its faces; re-check it after every edit and drop it with a warning if it is lost | Not built; risk is silently stale locks |
| Rule-aware tilt | Tilting a wall carries ribs and tangent fillets along | Not built; the notes suggest parking it as a non-goal |

## 2. Tool workflow ideas

A prioritised list from the workflow comparison. Sizes: S under half a session, M about one, L several.

1. Status line names the armed or default tool and its target ("Drag: push/pull this face"). S. Check: the hint line and first-use tips exist.
2. Mode options declared as data and shown as chips on a tool (add, cut or new body; both sides; keep the tool; tangent chain). M. Not built as a general mechanism.
3. Named slots for tools with several picks (target and tool, profile and axis, profile and path, neutral and target faces) instead of selection order. M. Not built.
4. An always-visible number field with the current value, Tab between fields, replacing the "0 means unchanged" workaround in the resize forms. M. Not built.
5. A hotkey field in each tool declaration and one key table, plus a repeat-last-command key beside Edit last. S to M. Check: the key table exists (`keys.ts`); repeat-last was not found.
6. A boolean choice built into the tools that make volume (extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, push/pull). M. Not built.
7. A failure cue on the model: highlight the faces or edges the kernel names when an operation fails, beside the red status. M. Not built.
8. Axis lock keys (X, Y, Z) and free direction for move and array tools. L. Shares work with the planned one push/pull path and array gizmos rows in progress.md.
9. Up To and Full Pull: push or pull until a chosen face or plane. M. Not built (no code found).
10. Fillets: tangent chain on by default and a warning when a large radius is applied before a small one. S to M. Not built.
11. Edit a pattern from one of its members (count, spacing). Needs a light pattern record; see section 5. Long term.
12. Modifier bundles on drag (Shift, Alt, Ctrl variations) once chips exist. S. This is the same topic as the mouse-modifier shortcuts in the planned one push/pull path row.

## 3. Drawing and direct-edit ideas

- **Plane from the face under the cursor.** The first click of a draw tool fixes the plane to the flat face under the pointer, otherwise the base plane; arrow keys force a plane. Check: "Sketch On Geometry" exists, so this is probably partly there.
- **Snap priority ladder.** Order: exact points (ends, midpoints, face and hole centres), then axis lock from the last point, then an axis ray ending where it crosses an edge, then on-edge, on-face, plane; the status text names the snap. Check against `sketchsnap.ts`.
- **Pull stops.** Push/pull snaps inward drags to the far face when the profile is fully covered (an exact through-cut), and snaps to the level of other parallel faces or edges, landing exactly on a level that is within a hair. Check: the watchlist mentions an opposite-face rule for symmetric push/pull only.
- **Loose lines that close into a face by themselves**, and **drawing straight into a body to split its face.** Conflicts: kept sketches stay separate and add no faces on Finish (behavior.md), so only the plane and snap ideas fit.
- **Drawing on curved faces** (a straight segment in the face's own coordinates becomes an exact curve on the surface). Not built; later.
- **Merge coplanar neighbours after booleans.** Mostly useful for mesh imports, which are not supported yet.

## 4. Sketch ideas still open

Most of the sketch parity list is built (conflict naming, free-point colouring, collinear, lock, point to line distance, reference dimensions, edit selection, slot, three-point arcs and circles, check sketch, kept sketches). What the notes list that is not built or is parked:

- **Sketch on the view plane** ("sketch on screen": a plane square to the camera). Cheap, needs no model geometry. Not built.
- **Plane tangent to a surface, plane square to a curve.** Parked; edge-normal planes are done.
- **A second solver** for full ellipse and spline shape constraints. The notes recommend keeping the current solver and giving ellipses and splines endpoint constraints only; evaluate the other solver on a test set before any switch. Parked.
- **Control-point splines with weights and knots, hyperbola and parabola arcs.** Parked.
- **Live (associative) projected edges** instead of snapshots. Parked; the notes say snapshots suit a model without history.
- **Internal alignment and tangent-at-endpoint with an angle.** Not built.
- **Named values and expressions in dimensions.** The owner chose numbers only for now (progress.md long-term list).
- **A parity checklist:** tick each sketch tool and constraint of a reference program as Done, Different (and why) or Not wanted; keep a scenario set (dimensioned rectangle, slot, tangent chain, symmetric profile, ellipse in a rectangle, spline through points) that every solver change must keep solving without flips.
- **Show what auto-removal changed**, and never silently delete the wrong constraint: show or ask. Check against the existing redundancy reporting.

## 5. Stored recipes and arrays (feeds the stored array parameters row)

A comparison of how other tools treat a primitive after it is combined with something gave three options for a tool with no history:

- **A.** The combined result becomes an ordinary solid; sizes are lost, undo is the way back. Simplest. This is how arrays work today.
- **B.** Keep each part's recipe as a hidden record that an explicit "separate" command restores. Drop it when any face-level edit touches the result; rigid moves keep it. The notes recommend this.
- **C.** Keep a nested group (fully reversible, but a hidden history every tool must understand).

The evidence is thin (a few searches, mostly unverified), so treat it as a question for the owner, not a finding. It bears on the stored array parameters questions: store array parameters like primitives do, or make the array a compound with its source object.

## 6. Questions raised by the notes

Four of them are in [questions.md](questions.md): stored array settings, Up To and Full Pull, soft locks and round maintenance. The other open questions in the notes (daily-use rules, hotkey letters, plain Delete on a face, repeat-last key, gizmo-first versus drag-only, blocking versus hint for fillet order) were left out as lower priority; the notes keep them with the defaults the research suggested.
