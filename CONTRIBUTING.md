# Contributing

## Commit messages

Write commits for someone reading the log later.

- Subject: 12 to 72 characters, capitalized, imperative, no trailing period, no labels such as `S22:`, `feat:` or `Progress:`. Say what the change does.
- Body: any commit touching 3 or more files needs a short body saying what changed and why. Wrap lines at 80 characters.
- One commit per logical change, not one per work step.
- Do not name commercial products or other programs (other CAD tools, AI tools, vendors); describe the behavior instead.
- Files, not just messages, must not name other products. Describe behavior in our own words and do not say it follows or matches another program.

`scripts/check_commit_message.py` enforces the message rules and `scripts/check_content.py` blocks other products' names in added lines. Enable the hooks once per clone:

    git config core.hooksPath .githooks

The `commit-lint` workflow runs the same check on pushes and pull requests.

## Reference material

Notes about how other tools work stay in `docs/research/`, which is ignored by git and never committed or pushed. Write them in our own words. Nothing is copied from other tools: no code, no text, no screenshots.
